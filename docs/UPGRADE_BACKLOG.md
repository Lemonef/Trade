# Upgrade backlog — triaged, parked, not lost

Items collected during the 2026-07 upgrade research sweep. Each entry keeps its
provenance so it can be traced back. Nothing here is adopted without passing the same
bar as everything else: tested / measured before promotion.

Active project: **Alpha Factory** — see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-alpha-factory-design.md`. Absorbed into that design
(not listed below): Alpha158/Jansen factor families, Kalman spread factors, GARCH-style
vol-regime factors, Williams VIX Fix capitulation family, IC/ICIR + signal-decay
scoreboard, GBM synthetic-data harness tests, universe expansion.

## Phase 2 — ML ranker (queued behind Alpha Factory)
- Cross-sectional ML ranker (LightGBM-style, scikit-learn) trained on the factory's
  factor panel; evaluated under the same purged walk-forward + FDR rules.
  _Provenance: Qlib workflow, Machine-Learning-for-Trading (Jansen)._

## Phase 3 — stock side (spike-hunter)
- Stock daily-OHLCV panel through the same factory harness → systematic pre-screen
  feeding the daily shortlist (LLM stays the judge). _Provenance: phase-1 design._
- Adversarial bear pass: a "short-seller attacks this thesis" step before any name
  enters 🆕 PROPOSED ADDITIONS; report shows attack + survival. _Provenance: viral
  prompt list, matches the blind-judge adversarial pattern already in use._
- Transcript forensics: for shortlisted names, pull earnings call / filing via the
  Bigdata MCP; extract tone shift, guidance walkbacks, dodged questions as one data
  row in the deep-dive. _Provenance: viral prompt list._
- Cohort correlation audit in the weekly review: which held names crash together,
  single-event exposure, concentration score (the June defense-cohort de-rate would
  have flagged). _Provenance: viral prompt list (portfolio exposure audit)._

## Go-live gate (before real money, any asset class)
- Execution-quality checklist: spreads, slippage, order types, fee totals, fill-price
  tracking vs quote at order time. _Provenance: "Jane Street microstructure" prompt —
  the one keeper of that batch._

## Infra / cosmetic (independent projects)
- Dashboard UI glow-up for the web pages; reference aesthetics: linear.app, notion,
  vercel, sodaven.com, storytelling.noomoagency.com, harmony. Use installed design
  skills.
- Agent tooling to evaluate someday: andrej-karpathy-skills, obsidian-skills,
  Agent-Reach repo, "Omega prism". Separate from quant work.
- Fable/Claude use-case ideas (from a viral list): clone paid apps locally (e.g. a
  Whisper-Flow-alike — research its architecture first), /goal-style workflows, audit
  runs, "visual agentic OS", bug hunts, ship-from-a-single-PRD. Evaluate case by case.
- Awesome-Quant: link index only — the place to look when hunting for a library or
  reference on a specific quant topic; nothing to build from directly.

## Unresolved (needs clarification from the owner)
- "RSI + Alchemist" — unidentified reference (an indicator? a TradingView script?).
  Clarify and triage; plain RSI-family factors are already in the factory zoo.

## Explicitly rejected (with reason, so they stay rejected)
- LLM-imagined backtests ("Two Sigma simulator" prompt): fabricated numbers; the real
  engine + factory exist.
- Chart-pattern technical analysis packs: repo history shows TA variants lose OOS
  (`backtest_results/IMPROVEMENTS_TRIED.md`).
- Options/derivatives strategy material (GS-Quant, pricing-course repos, D.E. Shaw
  prompt): no options traded. Revisit only if an options leg is ever added.
- Bloomberg terminal data: requires a paid terminal login; university lab access is
  the realistic route. Free sources cover current needs.
- Server-side web patterns (Redis, bloom filters, cache-null TTL, TanStack Query):
  static Pages site has no server; no cache problem at current scale.
- Managed vector DB / LangChain / Pinecone RAG: the brain's local hybrid search
  (`tools/semantic_search.py` v2) already covers retrieval at vault scale.
- "Act as a senior X" prompt packs: use the installed skills/commands instead — see
  brain `memory/claude-code-tooling-map.md`.
