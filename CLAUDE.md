# Quant — Trading Bot Project

Automated trading strategy R&D. Owner: Zen (19, Thai uni student). Capital ~$2,800
(100k Baht). Goal: 20M Baht by early 30s. Fully automated only. High risk tolerance.

## Infrastructure
- **TradingView** paper trading (Gold/SOL, Trend Meter Long Only).
- **MT5 Demo** (Exness) for XAUUSD.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Actions (cloud, free) runs the paper bot every 4h. (Azure student VPS retired.)
- Languages: Pine Script v5 + MQL5 + Python.
- (Personal account numbers/IPs kept out of this public repo.)

## Files (folder per strategy; all Pine v5, mq5 removed)
| File | What |
|---|---|
| `strategies/trend-meter/TM_LongOnly.pine` | Strategy 1 — Trend Meter long-only (EMA 13/21/34/55 + Stoch RSI). |
| `strategies/trend-meter/TM_LongShort.pine` | Strategy 1 — Trend Meter long+short (exit on band flip). |
| `strategies/momentum-reversion/MR_V2.pine` | Strategy 2 — no RSI70 exit, no volume filter, wider zones, 5% risk. (V1 removed: over-filtered.) |
| `strategies/quant-blend/QB_V1.pine` | Strategy 3 — ADX regime + Supertrend + RSI + Bollinger. |
| `strategies/quant-blend/QB_V2_hybrid.pine` | Strategy 3b — QB regime switch with Donchian trend leg. Wins BTC 4H (CAGR 27.81%). |
| `strategies/quant-blend/QB_V3.pine` | Strategy 3c — per-asset engine map + ATR chandelier trailing. Tested: per-asset map failed (starves SOL/XAU), chandelier mixed. See QB_V3_AND_PORTFOLIO.md. |
| `strategies/donchian-breakout/DONCHIAN_V1.pine` | Strategy 4 — pure breakout, hold trend, exit on prior M-low. |
| `backtest_results/SWEEP_2023_4H.md` | Full 5-strategy × 4-market sweep (2023-26). |

## Current best — QB V1 on SOL 4H
CAGR 23.63%, WR 59.38%, PF 2.3, DD 20.74%. Settings: Risk 5.0, ATR stop 2.5, ADX trend 25, ADX range 20.
Hitting ceiling ~23% CAGR (pyramid + daily TF didn't help).

## Target for any new strategy
CAGR 30%+, WR 55%+, DD <20%, PF 2.0+.

## ★ RECOMMENDED CORE (after full research — backtest_results/QUANT_METHODOLOGY.md)
**Donchian 55/20 breakout + 200-MA market filter**, long-only, ATR stops, equal-weight **~20-25 coin**
basket, 4H. Params locked by walk-forward (55/20 beat re-optimizing). Pine:
`strategies/donchian-breakout/PYRAMID_DONCHIAN.pine` (MA filter ON, defaults 55/20).
- **Universe expansion was the one clean win** (non-overfit): 10→20 coins lifted OOS Sharpe
  0.61→0.91, CAGR up, DD down to 18%. Saturates ~15-20 coins.
- Honest OOS (2024-26): ~17% CAGR, DD 18%, **Sharpe ~0.9** at 1x. Leverage: 2x≈35%/38%DD, 3x≈52%/57%.
- Everything fancier (mean-rev, momentum, long/short, ensembles, vol-target, always-in TM flip)
  beat it in-sample but LOST out-of-sample (overfitting). See backtest_results/IMPROVEMENTS_TRIED.md.
**Reality check:** Sharpe ~1.0-1.1 is the honest ceiling for robust crypto systematic. 70-80% CAGR
only via ~3x leverage = ~50% DD (Sharpe preserved). No robust low-DD 70-80% config exists — the
earlier one was a bug. Momentum (TSMOM/combo) gets Sharpe ~1 too but DD 60-75% (no stops).

## Key lessons
- Removing RSI 70 exit = biggest single win (V1→V2 ETH).
- ADX regime detection fixed Gold DD (32% → 3.76%).
- Volume filter kills too many good trades — remove.
- ADX 25 is the sweet spot (lower = worse).
- Wider ATR stop (2.5x) > tighter.
- **Best market: SOL 4H** (momentum + clear trends).
- Dead markets: ETH, EURUSD, Nasdaq, Gold. EURUSD totally incompatible (7% WR).

## Backtest workflow (TradingView via agent-browser)
1. Browser **headed** (`--headed --profile "Profile 2"`) so Zen sees it. Google OAuth is blocked
   on automation Chrome → log in with TradingView **Email**, not "Continue with Google".
2. Pine Editor → paste code via clipboard (`Set-Clipboard` + click editor, Ctrl+A, Delete, Ctrl+V).
   The compile button is the **unlabeled icon button just left of "Publish script"**.
3. **Collapse multi-line boolean expressions to ONE line before pasting.** Pine implicit
   line-continuation (`x = a and \n  b and \n  c`) breaks in Monaco paste → "end of line without
   line continuation". Function-arg continuations inside `(...)` are safe. (MR V1, QB V1 needed this.)
4. Set symbol via symbol button → search `BINANCE:BTCUSDT` etc. (`OANDA:XAUUSD` for gold).
5. Date range: Strategy Tester date dropdown → "Custom date range" → start `2023-01-01`.
   **Date range RESETS to chart-start whenever you switch SCRIPT (Add to chart) — re-set it.**
   It PERSISTS across symbol changes and across "Update on chart" (same instance).

### MANDATORY pre-record checklist (every single read)
1. **Full report** read from DOM snapshot (returns all stats incl. CAGR; no scrolling needed).
2. **Date range** = `Jan 1, 2023 — Jun 6, 2026` (verify the button text).
3. **Refreshed** — if "The report is outdated" / Update report button shows, CLICK it; re-read.
4. **Right model** — active strategy name in report = the strategy being tested (not a leftover).
5. **Clean up** any scratch png created for diagnosis (read from DOM instead; delete pngs after).

Read: Total PnL %, Max drawdown %, Profitable trades (WR + n/N), Profit factor, CAGR.

## Full sweep — 4H, 2023-01-01 → 2026-06-06 (file-default params)
See `backtest_results/SWEEP_2023_4H.md` for the complete 20-cell table. Highlights:
| Strategy | Best market | CAGR | WR | PF | DD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TM Long Only | SOL | 48.84% | 33.82% | 1.452 | 36.20% |
| TM Long Only | BTC | 39.52% | 38.89% | 1.876 | 19.21% |
| TM Long Only | XAU | 13.62% | 46.30% | 2.174 | 8.42% |
| Donchian V1 | BTC | 24.77% | 33.80% | 1.48 | 26.09% |
| Donchian V1 | ETH | 23.26% | 32.76% | 1.552 | 21.63% |
| QB V1 (default) | SOL | 11.55% | 59.38% | 2.78 | 5.23% |
| QB V1 (default) | XAU | 4.73% | 52.63% | 3.084 | 3.76% |
| MR V2 | BTC | 11.12% | 58.33% | 1.99 | 18.17% |
| MR V2 | XAU | 1.70% | 58.33% | 2.464 | 3.33% |

**Cross-finding:** QB V1 wins mean-reversion markets (SOL/XAU), loses BTC/ETH. Donchian is the
opposite — wins trending BTC/ETH, loses SOL/XAU. TM-LO = highest CAGR but highest DD; shorts (L+S)
always hurt. QB V1 at file-default sizing is conservative; tuned (Risk 5/ATR 2.5) → SOL ~23.63%.

## QB V2 Hybrid (Donchian trend leg) — see backtest_results/QB_V2_HYBRID.md
Swapping QB's trend leg for Donchian flips the camp: BTC 4H **CAGR 27.81%** (PF 1.59, DD 20.7%),
ETH +18.69% — but breaks SOL (−5.91%). 1D = higher quality / lower CAGR (BTC PF 2.50, DD 9.2%).
TF matters: 4H for CAGR, 1D for safety; 1D un-breaks SOL (thin sample). No single market+TF hits
all targets. **Best deployment = Hybrid on BTC/ETH + QB V1 on SOL/XAU (diversified book).**

## Python backtest engine + pyramided-Donchian basket (backtest/) — CORRECTED
Built a Python engine (`backtest/engine.py`) to test pyramiding/leverage/portfolio. Binance, 10
coins, 4H. **A pyramiding bug initially showed 108% CAGR / Sharpe 2.6 — that was free leverage
(added units, only charged fees). FIXED.** Honest numbers below; lesson: a +1000% / Sharpe>3 crypto
backtest is a bug until proven otherwise (caught it when 2022 bear showed +505% on a coin down 90%).
- Real basket (equal-weight, fixed engine) 2023-26: **CAGR 5.56% / DD 34% / Sharpe 0.35.** Leverage
  doesn't help (Sharpe flat ~0.4).
- **Fails out-of-sample**: TRAIN 2023-24 Sharpe 0.70 → TEST 2025-26 Sharpe 0.00 (−2.6% CAGR).
- **Bear OOS 2021-2022**: 2021 bull +148% (Sh 2.57) but **2022 crash −19% (Sh −0.90)**.
- = long-only crypto **trend BETA**: wins bull, bleeds bear/chop. Only BTC sleeve stable (Sh 0.95).
- Next: 200-MA market filter (skip bears), concentrate on BTC, walk-forward, intrabar stops, funding.
- Pine version: `strategies/donchian-breakout/PYRAMID_DONCHIAN.pine` (has 200-MA filter toggle).
- Full corrected report: backtest_results/PORTFOLIO_PYRAMID.md. `backtest/data/` gitignored.

## QB V3 + Portfolio (backtest_results/QB_V3_AND_PORTFOLIO.md)
V3 tried per-asset engine map + chandelier trailing. Both inconclusive: per-asset map starves
SOL/XAU (V1's profit needs its Supertrend trend leg, not generic reversion); chandelier helps ETH,
hurts BTC. **No single-strategy silver bullet.** Portfolio of specialists (BTC→Hybrid, ETH→V3,
SOL/XAU→V1) ≈ **16-19% CAGR, DD <15%, PF ~2** (analytical estimate — verify with a Python
multi-asset backtest before live). To chase 30%: size up the low-DD SOL/XAU sleeves (3-5% DD headroom).
